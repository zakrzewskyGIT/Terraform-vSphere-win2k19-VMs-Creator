# Terraform-vSphere-win2k19-VMs-Creator

This Terraform script creates and configures virtual machines on the vSphere platform, using a virtual template as a base, and then customizes them by modifying settings such as the computer name, domain join, networking configuration, and more. 
In this example, a Windows Server 2019 template is used, but it can be easily adapted to use templates of other Windows versions as well.
